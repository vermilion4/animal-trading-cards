            A Siberian husky is an unmistakable breed. Powerfully built and
            compact, the combination of their thick coat and piercing eyes marks
            them out among other dog breeds, and even among other high-latitude
            dog breeds. They look like noble savages, ready to take on the wild
            wastes they were bred to handle alongside their human masters in the
            early years of arctic civilization.

            Snow leopards are around 75-150cm from head to the base of the tail,
            with the tail adding on another 80-105cm, which makes them smaller
            than the other big cats. Snow leopards generally weigh between
            25-55kg, although some large males have been recorded weighing up to
            75kg.
